     "My journey to becoming a developer all started with a question: 'How does the internet actually work?' While in high school, I dabbled in a few online courses, and after graduating, I decided to attend a web development bootcamp to learn how to make websites—among other things. My passion for exploring the endless possibilities of technology led me to LC Studio, where I am eagerly expanding my skill set and knowledge. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like minded people who share my passion for technology and continuous learning."
